# Blog Aggregator Solution Repo | Legacy Version

We've updated the [build a blog aggregator in Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-blog-aggregator) project on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) significantly. It no longer serves an HTTP API, but instead is a CLI tool.

This is a snapshot of the _old_ solution repo, just in case you were caught in the middle of the update.

If you haven't started the project yet, I strongly recommend following along with the new version: https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-blog-aggregator
